Imports TensorFlowMLNETInceptionv3ModelScoring.Model

' IMPORTANT: This sample, needs ML.NET 0.6 NuGet packages, due to some bug fixes that happened after 0.5 release.
' For now, you can get it from MyGet in this Feed: https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json
'
' - TensorFlow https://www.tensorflow.org/ is a popular machine learning toolkit that enables training deep neural networks(and general numeric computations).
' - This sample show the usage of the ML.NET "TensorFlowScorer" transform that enables taking an existing TensorFlow model, either trained by you 
'   or downloaded from somewhere else, and get the scores from the TensorFlow model in ML.NET code.
' - For now (using LearningPipeline API), these scores can only be used within a LearningPipeline as inputs to a learner.
'   However, with the upcoming ML.NET APIs, the scores from the TensorFlow model will be directly accessible.
' - The implementation of this mentioned "TensorFlowScorer" transform is based on code from TensorFlowSharp.
'
' Sample code: Specifically, this sample code when training with the pipeline, it generates a numeric vector for each image that you have in the folder "images" 
' and correlates those numeric vectors with the types of objects/things provided in the "tags.tsv" file. 
' After that, the model is trained with an SDCA classifier (StochasticDualCoordinateAscentClassifier) that uses that relationship between numeric vectors and labels/tags. 
' so when using the model in a test or final app, you can classify any given image that is similar to any of the images used in the pipeline.
